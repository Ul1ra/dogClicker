# Dog Clicker
In m Udacity course, I was given an excersize where I had to create a cat clicker; having dog pictures on my phone, i turned it into a dog clicker. 
The purpose of this exercise was to be given a task and various steps where the requirements change, just like a real world project.

Each step has its own folder with a different HTML, CSS, JS file. 

### Requirement 1
* Include a title of the project, add an image and add a click counter that increments by 1 every single time the image is clicked on.

### Requirement 2
* Add another image with a title above the image and the click counter below for each image.

### Requirement 3
* Have a list of 5 images, once an image is clicked on, it opens on a large display showing the title above and the click counter below.
